# Module 7: Metrics and model development


##  Metrics

Metrics should be unbiased, universal, and concise.

1. A way to obtain similar responses
2. A way to measure the performance
3. A way to measure prediction


For our sample analysis we will use `KNN` k-Nearest Neighbor
- K is an arbitrary pick
- Need a `base case`
- Compare the neighbors
- Sort the results

Dataset for this analysis:
```bash
icarus.cs.weber.edu:~hvalle/cs4580/data/movies.csv
```

### KNN-Euclidean distance in the distance between points in `N-dimension` space.

Formula
$
d(p,q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2}
$
Where: 
- $p = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$
- $q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)$

Find the distance between these points:

- x = (0,0)
- y = (4,4)

Distance = 5.65685
